# CP1404 Practicals
## About 
This repository includes practical work for IT@JCU CP1404. 
My name is Ewa Buczkowska and I am currently in my second year at JCU studying a BSc in Data Science and Marine Biology.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
- "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) - Write reusable functions instead of duplicating code
- Single Responsibility Principle - Each function or class should handle one specific task
- Meaningful Names - Use descriptive variable and function names that explain their purpose
