# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started to give myself more time for practicals since my last reflection pointed out this was an issue. I'm also trying to watching lectures on weekends, but it has not been as consistent as I would like it to be.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to work on my time management with practicals. While I've improved somewhat, I need to make sure I have enough time to ask questions when I get stuck.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been quite consistent with watching lectures and taking notes, and doing the "Do This Now" exercises.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving practical work until I'm rushed, and I have not yet done the extra/extension work in the practicals.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It personally helps me me the lecture videos have a title/number, so it is easier to keep track and come back to it. Some modules have that, but some modules do not. I would like to request for that to be consistent.
