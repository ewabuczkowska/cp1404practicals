# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Honestly I found it hard to determine that, because I would not write programs in one go, 
but rather in very small snippets, which is something I want to work on. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I would think I need more time then I actually did, but my estimations usually were quite good.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That it still takes me very long to code. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

All the reviews I did receive, were really helpful. 
Sometimes they pointed out things that are juste asy to forget and sometimes actual 
structure issues I did not notice or understand how to fix. 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That there are very different approaches 
and also different ways to complete and plan or undertake assignments. 
It also made me double check my work to see if I did similar mistakes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

I only got mentioned twice and was therefore only able to do two reviews!
### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

I tried my best to be polite, when pointing out some of the mistakes I saw. 
Sometimes I struggled with realizing if something is wring, or jsut different than what I did, but in this case I feel like
I was able to focus on forgotten/ not completely correct parts. 

### Good Code Review 2

[ZHANGJIALELLLLL/Prac_07](https://github.com/ZHANGJIALELLLLL/cp1404practicals./pull/5#pullrequestreview-2456547810)

### Explanation

I tried to be good in communicating some very obvious things I noticed. 
In this case I struggled more with seeing if something is incorrect or just different, but I hoe my suggestions 
were helpful.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I really liked the demo parts of the pracs, as they would help me understand everything a little better.
I also really liked how easy ikt is to understand what is needed regarding submission and requirements.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I would say I was quite consistent. The last two, I submitted a little late, which is my fault, 
but I really tried to do them well, as they help me learn a lot.
